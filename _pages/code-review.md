For this code review, I have chosen the code from my final project from Full Stack Development I CS 465 to enhance for this capstone course. I have chosen this so that I have a framework to improve my code from, and also gain insight into my work from a fresh perspective since some time has passed from the project’s last commit.  

For [software design and engineering]({{base_path}}/artifacts/software_design_and_engineering), I will review the existing code's functionality by analyzing its features and operations. The goal is to clearly describe what the code does, including its structure, logic, and functionality. Using the checklist, I will evaluate the design for weaknesses such as deviations from secure coding practices, inefficient logic, or insufficient error handling. Specific criteria will include whether the code adheres to coding standards, uses modular design, and maintains proper commenting and documentation.  

For [algorithms and data structures]({{base_path}}/artifacts/algorithms_and_data_structures), I will focus on the efficiency and functionality of the algorithms and data structures used in the code. I will describe the existing code's purpose, detailing its computational processes and how data is managed. Using the checklist, I will assess the code for efficiency, ensuring that operations are optimized and unnecessary redundancies are minimized. For example, I will check for inappropriate use of loops or inefficient sorting techniques.  

The [database]({{base_path}}/artifacts/databases) review will involve analyzing how the code interacts with data storage systems, focusing on functionality, security, and efficiency. I will describe the code’s handling of database operations, such as querying, updating, and managing data. Using the checklist, I will critically evaluate database interactions, highlighting weaknesses like poor query optimization, lack of parameterized queries, or inadequate handling of sensitive data.  

For each category, I will use the CS 499 checklist as a foundation to systematically evaluate the code. Any issues pertaining to the three categories will be acknowledged and noted for improvement.
